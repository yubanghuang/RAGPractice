      "B. Darrow of Germantown Pennsylvania. Mr. Darrow, like. many other Americans, was unemployed at the time and he worked out the \n",
      "details of the game primarily to amuse himself during this period. Prior to the Depression, Darrow and his wife vacationed in the resort \n",
      "town of Atlantic City, New Jersey. When it came to naming the streets on the game board, Darrow naturally adopted those of his favorite \n",
      "vacation spot. \n",
      "The first games were handmade. Darrow gave them to friends and sold a few through a Philadelphia department store. As the demand for \n",
      "the game grew, Darrow could not keep up with the orders and arranged for Parker Brothers to take over the game. \n",
      "Since 1935 when Parker Brothers acquired the rights to the game, it has become the leading proprietary game not only in the United States \n",
